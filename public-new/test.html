<h3>CONCEPT</h3>
<blockquote>"Now everything that becomes or is created must of necessity be created by some cause, for without a cause nothing can be created."</blockquote>
<p>The quote of Platon created the though that everything that becomes created must be based on an idea. This is where the question comes up, how exactly does the idea develop to the final creation/work.<br />
The new collection „ko´ko“ is shaped by the development of a hasty thought to an completed idea. This journey is symbolised by the metaphor of a cocoon. Like an euruca the idea dozes in the cocoon, sheltered by soft, finespun filaments, still permeable for influences of the outside world. The idea grows up, protected by a cocoon, and makes room for itself so that it can reduce down to its essence at completion.</p>

<h4>Seperation in three phases:</h4>
<p>The development of the collection is split into three phases: the first phase is the  description of the initial state, the source with all of its influences, them being cultural, social or ethnological. These influences create the impulse to move the collection to stage two.<br />
This again is seperated in three parts: the phase of inspiration, gathering materials and exploring different, yet uncertain options. The second phase makes them more precise and narrows down the subject to let the idea emerge and manifest its nucleus in the third phase.<br />
The idea is now fully developed and comes to the world. Hence you go back to the original state, making room for new ideas. The circle closes.</p>


<h3>SYMBOLISM</h3>

The most remarkable property of a cocoon is the poise between fragility and stability. If looked at seperately, the fine filament is inconsiderable and breakable. Only the interaction of its parts assembles the whole thing. However a cocoon always makes the impression of something emerging, something transient. Cocoons live for a moment, to collapse into its parts anytime and to create something new.<br />
This metaphor can be found in the collection too. Some outfits exhibit traces of the becoming, of the premature. This is symbolized by unsewed filament, which is similar to unfinished fabrics. The unfinished fabrics changes over time, unsews and steadily created something new. Every piece of the collection becomes an individual piece. The pieces change with their person wearing it and adjust to the person and his environment.<br/>
The openings at sleeves, back and sides is related to the spacing between the filaments of an unfinished cocoon. Translucent fabrics support the metaphor of transparency. Just like a cocoon the inside of pieces is visible at the beginning, but completely hidden at the end.
Transparent zipclips and buttons resemble the fragility of a cocoon. Providing safety and stability when being closed, they bare the vulnarable inside to the outside world.

<h4>Wood:</h4>
<p>The texture of the collars and necklace shows the grain of the wood. The grain exists because of annual rings. A multitude of winters and summers is stamped into the wood. Like summers and winters eternalized in the wood, the idea is formed by highs and lows. Therefore the grain of the wood is a symbol for maturation of a collection/idea.</p>


<h3>COLOUR CONCEPT</h3>

<p>The collection colors are of light shades, pale colors  with a little white content prevail. White playes a central role, the colors points to the beginning, the white sheet of paper. At the same time it stands for the lightness of a cocoon.
The second acromatic color in the collection is gray. Gray symbolizes thoughtfullness, the musings over an idea and the vage direction of it. <br />
In contrast to grey, blue supplements the colors as the color of utopia, the defined but unfinished direction. Being the color of fantasy it alludes the condition of each idea, being the color of water the required depths each idea needs.<br />
The last color is light green. The color of vitality it contrasts the other tones. The german vernecular says „somebody is green behind the ears“, which with each development step is less and less the case.</p>


<h3>FABRIC CONCEPT</h3>

<p>The materials of the collection consists to a majority of natural fiber. The apparent analogy to the cocoon and its constructor, the silkworm.<br />
The selected fabrics are rich of contrasts: lightweight fabricts are combined with compact fabrics, tranlucent are contrary to opaque ones. This mirros the balancing act between stability and fragility of the cocoon in the selection of fabrics. Where thin fabrics are used at the beginning, these fabrics become thicker and thicker to the end following the development of the collection.</p>


<h3>SILHOUETTES</h3>

<p>The fine woven cocoon develops its silhouette over time. Amorphic at the beginning it develops a shape over time. From seemingly chaotic silk threads a clearly defined structure develops. The inside of the cocoon makes room for evolvement: as soon as the inside is fully matured it breaks the cocoon and shows off ist potential.
The process of the development is mirrored in the collection. Every outfit represents a specific step in the development. Everything that becomes develops from a nucleus. Nucleus and outside world affect each other. This is expressed with the first outfit by ist clearly visibly balloon-like shape.
This is a metaphor for the enclosed cosmos. In the cosmos the spark for the idea is triggered, making the silhouette of the second outfit more open. Thus uncovering formerly invisible layers. To that effect sparked the idea takes its course.
At first various strands of ideas buzz around, all gathered without a final decision. This hesitance is found in the third outfit, the wide dress with its large wavy hem.<br/>
The next three outfits describe the idea slowly assumings shape. The silhouette becomes  more waisted, the structure more clearly defined. A clearer separation of top and  underpart becomes visibly. This metamorphose finds ist target in the next to last outfit: the reduction to the essential. The idea is accomplished and let out into the cosmos.
Letting out an idea allows a new beginning. This starts at the absolute zero. Going back to start is symbolize by the uniform shape of the last outfit.<br />
The circuit can now start again.</p>
